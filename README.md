# Network Host Reachability Monitor (Ping Project)

A simple, cross-platform C++ application designed to continuously monitor the reachability status of a predefined list of network hosts (IPs and domains). It logs host status (UP/DOWN) and generates alerts for any detected outages.

## Project Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of a continuous network monitoring utility. It acts as a basic health-check tool by regularly sending network requests (via the system's `ping` utility) to various public and local hosts to determine their accessibility. The primary goal is to simulate and execute basic packet communication checks.

## Features

* **Continuous Monitoring:** Runs in an infinite loop, checking host status at a fixed interval of **60 seconds**.
* **Cross-Platform Ping:** Uses platform-specific `ping` commands for Windows (`ping -n 1`) and Linux/macOS (`ping -c 1`).
* **Real-time Logging:** Writes a timestamped log entry for every host check to a file named `ping_log.txt`.
* **Console Output:** Prints the host status (UP/DOWN) directly to the console.
* **Alerting System:** Displays a clear `⚠️ ALERT` message on the console whenever a host is detected as **DOWN**.
* **Modular Code:** Written in C++ using standard libraries, allowing for future extension to measure Round-Trip Time (RTT) or integrate other network operations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run the network monitor on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., `g++`).
* The standard `ping` utility installed on your operating system.
* Terminal / Command-line access.
* ***Note on Permissions:*** The code relies on the standard system `ping` command.

### Build and Run

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) and navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ANUGRAH555/Computer-Network-Project.git](https://github.com/ANUGRAH555/Computer-Network-Project.git) 
    cd Computer-Network-Project
    ```
2.  **Compile the C++ source code:**
    ```bash
    g++ pingproj.cpp -o pingproj -std=c++11 -pthread
    ```
    *Note: The `-pthread` flag is required because the code uses `std::this_thread::sleep_for`.*
3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS
    ./pingproj

    # On Windows (cmd)
    pingproj.exe
    ```
    The program will immediately begin the monitoring process.

## Usage and Host List

The program continuously loops through a predefined list of hosts, performing a single `ping` check on each one.

### Monitored Hosts

The current list of hosts checked in `pingproj.cpp` includes a mix of public DNS servers, popular domains, and common local gateway IPs:

| Type | Hostname / IP | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public DNS** | `8.8.8.8`, `1.1.1.1`, `9.9.9.9`, `208.67.222.222`, `8.8.4.4`, `1.0.0.1` | Primary public/resolver checks. |
| **Websites** | `google.com`, `cloudflare.com`, `facebook.com`, `youtube.com`, `twitter.com`, `github.com`, `amazon.com`, `microsoft.com`, `apple.com`, `wikipedia.org`, `bing.com`, `reddit.com`, `linkedin.com` | Checks for general internet connectivity. |
| **Local** | `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.0.1` | Checks for local network gateway reachability. |
| **Test** | `example.com` | A domain reserved for documentation examples (expected to be always UP). |

To modify the host list, edit the `vector<string> hosts` variable in `pingproj.cpp` and recompile.

## How It Works

The core logic resides in `pingproj.cpp`:

1.  **`main()` loop:** The program enters an infinite `while(true)` loop.
2.  **`pingHost()` function:** For each host, the function constructs and executes a system command to run a single `ping` packet. It suppresses all `ping` output to the console and checks the exit code. An exit code of `0` means the host is **UP**; any other value means it is **DOWN**.
3.  **Logging:** The result, along with a timestamp generated by `getTimestamp()`, is appended to `ping_log.txt`.
4.  **Alerting:** If `pingHost` returns `false` (DOWN), a console alert is printed.
5.  **Delay:** After checking all hosts, the program pauses for `60` seconds before starting the next cycle.

## Sample Output / Logs

The program produces both console output and writes to `ping_log.txt`.
