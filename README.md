## Project Overview  
This project is a C++ implementation of a computer-networking assignment. The aim is to simulate/execute ping / packet communications (or whatever your code does) in a network context using sockets / ICMP / or custom logic. The repository contains the source code file (pingproj.cpp), a folder (pingproj) and a log (ping_log.txt) capturing sample runs.

## Features  
- Sends “ping” requests (or simulated network requests) and logs responses.  
- Measures round-trip time (RTT) or logs latency information.  
- Maintains a log file for analysis (ping_log.txt).  
- Modular code structure to allow extension to other network operations.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, version supporting C++11 or later)  
- On Linux/macOS: basic socket permissions (may require root for raw ICMP)  
- On Windows: equivalent environment (if applicable)  
- Terminal / Command-line access  

### Build & Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ANUGRAH555/Computer-Network-Project.git  
   cd Computer-Network-Project
